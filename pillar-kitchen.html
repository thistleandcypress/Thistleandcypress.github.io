    <p>The kitchen is where our heritage meets the seasons—where Scottish comfort and Italian abundance share the same table. Here we cook what the land offers, what the garden grows, and what feels right for the moment we’re in. This is a place for simple meals, slow rituals, and the joy of feeding the people we love.</p>

    <h2>Seasonal Recipes & Notes</h2>
    <p>As we build out this space, you’ll find seasonal dishes, pantry staples, and the stories behind the meals that anchor our year. From winter broths to summer harvest feasts, this section will grow with the seasons.</p>
