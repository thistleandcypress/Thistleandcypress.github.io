    <p>We are Rick and Jon, living between two coasts and building our future on 10 wooded acres in Northwest Pennsylvania. When we escape our busy West Coast careers to come here, we exhale. Drawing on Scottish resilience and Italian abundance, we’re slowly creating the life we’ll fully step into when we retire—one that includes travel to Italy and Scotland, immersion in food and wine, and deep connection to this land. This is our table, our garden, our work—and we invite you to pull up a chair.</p>
