    <p>Craft is the work of our hands and the inheritance of those who came before us. It’s the mending, the making, the preserving, and the quiet satisfaction of creating something useful or beautiful. Here we honor the skills passed down through generations and the new ones we’re learning as we build a life rooted in care and intention.</p>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Projects, Skills & Seasonal Work</h2>
    <p>As this space grows, you’ll find woodworking projects, preservation notes, handmade tools, repairs, and the small acts of craft that shape a home over time.</p>
