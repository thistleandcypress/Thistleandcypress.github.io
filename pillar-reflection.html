  <!-- Section 1: Light as a Universal Symbol -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🌟 Light as a Universal Symbol</h2>
    <p>
      Light has long symbolized hope, guidance, and divine presence across traditions. In Judaism, light is central—from “Let there be light” in Genesis to the menorah and Shabbat candles as expressions of holiness and divine revelation; in Christianity, Christ is “the light of the world”; and in Islam, God is “the Light of the heavens and the earth.”

  <!-- Section 2: Cycles of Renewal -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🌱 Cycles of Renewal and the Turning of the Year</h2>
    <p>
      Life moves in cycles—creation, formation, growth, challenge, and renewal. The biblical “Tree of Life” appears in Genesis, Proverbs, and Revelation in Jewish and Christian texts, while later Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) uses the Tree of Life as a map of the four worlds and the Sefirot (divine qualities) to frame spiritual development.

    <p><strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> Which “phase” of your life needs tending as you step into the new year?</p>

  <!-- Section 3: Angels and Messengers -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🌌 Angels We Have Heard on High: Messengers of Transition</h2>
    <p>
      Angels appear across Abrahamic traditions as messengers and mediators of divine guidance—Gabriel in Christianity and Islam, Michael and others in Jewish texts—often described as luminous beings. This bridges traditions and invites us to notice the “messengers” in our own lives—dreams, intuition, or timely encounters.

    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> What messages of guidance are you receiving as the solstice and new year approach?</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4: Advent, Hanukkah and Solstice as Sacred Pause -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🍃 Advent, Hanukkah and Solstice as Sacred Pause</h2>
    <p>
      This season is a sacred pause before the return of light: Advent’s waiting for Christ, Hanukkah’s celebration of light and resilience, and the solstice’s turning point toward longer days. Each tradition invites contemplation, renewal, and hope.

  </section>

  <!-- Section 5: Intention & Alignment -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🔔 Intention and Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      Kabbalah’s Sefirot offer archetypal qualities—kindness (Chesed), strength (Gevurah), balance/beauty (Tiferet)—that align with universal values and can complement Christian practices of prayer and virtue. These are described as divine emanations—channels through which divine light flows into creation.
