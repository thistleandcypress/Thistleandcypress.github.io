  <H2>Pause and Reflect This Holiday Season:</H2>
  <H3> <I>Leverage the reflection promps below to help step away from the chaos of the world and celebrate how far you've come in 2025 -- everything you've achieved, all you are grateful for, and what you look forward to in 2026.</I></H3>

  <!-- Section 1: Light as a Universal Symbol -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🌟 Light as a Universal Symbol</h2>
    <p>Light has always been a symbol of hope, guidance, and divine presence. Whether seen in candles, stars, or the warmth of community, it reminds us of the ways we are guided through transitions.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> How does light guide you through personal, seasonal, or spiritual transitions?</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2: Cycles of Renewal -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🌱 Cycles of Renewal and the Turning of the Year</h2>
    <p>Life moves in cycles—creation, growth, challenge, and completion. As the year turns, we are invited to reflect on where we are in our own cycle and what new beginnings await.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> Which “phase” of your life needs tending as you step into the new year?</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3: Angels and Messengers -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🌌 Angels We Have Heard on High: Messengers of Transition</h2>
    <p>Angels appear across religious tradiations -- from the Christian bible and the Jewish Torah, to the Islamic Quran. While we may think of angels as phyiscal messengers or intermediators, Angels can also be understood as emanations of light and guidance, bridging traditions and reminding us of the messengers in our own lives—dreams, intuition, or people who arrive at the right moment.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> What messages of guidance are you receiving as the solstice and new year approach?</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4: Advent, Hannakah and Solstice as Sacred Pause -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🍃 Advent, Hannakuah and Solstice as Sacred Pause</h2>
    <p>This is a moment of stillness before the return of light. It resonates with traditions of waiting, contemplation, and renewal. In the pause, wisdom emerges.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> What wisdom emerges when you allow yourself to rest in the dark before the dawn?</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 5: Intention & Alignment -->
  <section class="reflection-section">
    <h2>🔔 Intention and Alignment</h2>
    <p>Practices such as mindfulness, Kabbalah, and Christian prayer and meditation are about living with intention and reflection—kindness, strength, balance—that can be embraced universally. They invite us to cultivate qualities that align our lives with deeper purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection Prompt:</strong> Which qualities do you want to cultivate more fully in the coming year?</p>
