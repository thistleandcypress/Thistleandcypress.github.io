    <p>Rhythm is the quiet pulse beneath everything we do—the turning of seasons, the lessons of the land, and the meaning found in the work of tending a life. Here we follow the wheel of the year, honor the shifts in light and weather, and reflect on how the land shapes us as much as we shape it.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Seasonal Reflections & Field Notes</h2>
    <p>This space will grow into a journal of the land: solstice and equinox notes, seasonal markers, small observations, and the stories that emerge from paying attention. Over time, it will become a record of how this place changes—and how we change with it.</p>
