    <p>These ten acres are the heart of our future—woodland slowly becoming orchard, garden, and wild edge. We’re learning the land season by season, clearing paths, planting what will feed us, and letting the forest teach us its own pace. This is a place of beginnings, experiments, and the long work of tending something that will outlast us.</p>

    <h2>Garden Plans & Seasonal Notes</h2>
    <p>As this space grows, you’ll find orchard maps, planting notes, seasonal tasks, and the stories of what thrives—and what doesn’t—as we learn this land from the ground up.</p>
