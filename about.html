  <p>Thistle & Cypress is the authentic and heartfelt expression of two partners carving out a life together on ten acres of rolling land in Western Pennsylvania. Rooted in Scottish and Italian heritage, the brand symbolizes the merging of two cultures, identities, and histories — the rugged resilience of the thistle and the deep-rooted elegance of the cypress.</p>

  <p>Our journey is both deeply personal and universally inspiring: a love story of creating home, cultivating land, and building community through openness, craft, and intentional living. It values patience, learning, and the beauty of useful things.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."</p>
    <cite>— from <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> (2001), written by Eden Ahbez</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This sentiment, from our favorite movie, <em>Moulin Rouge!</em>, captures the heart of our philosophy at Thistle & Cypress.</p>

  <p>We draw inspiration from the natural world, weaving together the rhythms of the seasons with the rituals of home. Whether it’s planting seeds in spring, crafting cozy meals in winter, or simply reflecting by the hearth, each season becomes an opportunity to live intentionally and create with purpose.</p>

  <p>At Thistle & Cypress, we believe that tending to the home — through shared meals, handmade objects, and mindful practices — is a form of nourishment in itself. Our philosophy is rooted in patience, care, and a commitment to living intentionally, understanding that true beauty often lies in the everyday rituals of creating and tending.</p>

  <p>Join us as we explore the intersection of tradition and creativity, and celebrate the joy of living intentionally and with care. Each project is an invitation to slow down, notice the details, and find meaning in the simple beauty of useful things.</p>
